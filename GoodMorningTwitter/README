Good Morning Twitter!
An arduino solution to Tell Twitter when you are awake.
By Gonzalo Maldonado

This works by measuring the light intensity in a room in order to determine if your up or not (as anyone who has played h2g2 knows, it's the first thing to do in the morning)

Usage:
	1. program your arduino using gmt.pde (follow the schematics included in that file)
	2. run python goodMorning.py (it will ask for your username password and message)
		2.1 Turn on your lights (or keep them on) and press enter
		2.2 Turn off your lights and press enter
		2.3 Go to bed and sleep
	3. When you wake up and turn up your light your message will be twitted.

Good night.
